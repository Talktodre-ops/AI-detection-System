# Claude Code Instructions

## Addressing
- Always address the user as "Dre"

## Code Quality Standards

### 1. Code Clarity
- Write self-documenting code with clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Use meaningful names that convey intent: `getUserById()` not `get()`
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are industry-standard (e.g., `id`, `url`, `api`)
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

### 2. Code Structure
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Use consistent indentation (spaces/tabs as per project convention)
- Maximum function length: 50 lines (refactor if longer)
- Maximum file length: 300 lines (split if longer)
- Group related functionality together

### 3. Unambiguous Code
- Avoid implicit type conversions
- Use explicit return statements
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals
- Make all edge cases explicit
- Use enums or constants instead of magic numbers/strings
- Add type annotations (TypeScript/Python) or JSDoc comments

### 4. Error Handling
- Never swallow errors silently
- Use specific error types, not generic `Error`
- Validate inputs at function boundaries
- Provide meaningful error messages with context
- Handle all promise rejections

### 5. Comments & Documentation
- Write comments that explain "why", not "what"
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use JSDoc/TSDoc for public APIs
- Remove commented-out code (use git history instead)

### 6. Best Practices
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - extract repeated logic
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - prefer simple solutions
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - don't add unused features
- Immutability: prefer const over let, avoid mutations
- Pure functions where possible (no side effects)

### 7. Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages
- Use descriptive test names: `should_return_error_when_user_not_found`
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Mock external dependencies

### 8. Code Review Readiness
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Write clear commit messages
- Remove debug code and console.logs
- Ensure no linting errors
- Format code consistently

### 9. Security
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated

### 10. Performance
- Avoid premature optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures
- Minimize nested loops
- Cache expensive computations when appropriate

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use `const` by default, `let` when necessary, never `var`
- Prefer async/await over raw promises
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)
- Leverage TypeScript's strict mode
- Use functional array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use f-strings for formatting
- Leverage list/dict comprehensions appropriately
- Use context managers (`with` statements)

### General
- Follow existing project conventions
- Use project's linting and formatting tools
- Keep dependencies minimal and justified
- Write portable, cross-platform code when possible
