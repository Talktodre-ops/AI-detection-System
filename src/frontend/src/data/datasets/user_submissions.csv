"Self-awareness is like having a mirror for your mind—it’s the ability to recognize and understand your own emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It's what helps you realize why you react a certain way in situations, identify your strengths and weaknesses, and improve your interactions with others.

There are two main types of self-awareness:

Internal Self-Awareness – This is about understanding yourself, your values, and what drives you. It helps you make decisions that align with who you are.

External Self-Awareness – This is about knowing how others perceive you. It allows you to adjust your behavior and communication for better relationships.
