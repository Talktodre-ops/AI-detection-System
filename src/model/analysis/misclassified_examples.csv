1.0,my first opinion would be that to be a goof person does you have to be your self no matter what is going to happen for example a goof behavior star at home because your parents have the responsibility to educate also some people saiph the students are very baf for other students like they are baf influence my second reason would be the own problems can affect your career for example your grades at school if you are a goof person with other people to be a goof citizen just be you because people the just talk never for something goof but sometimes teen fort reserve what they have for example school job people the love them after that well if you work that is a goof idea because you can focus anf two things but if you are weak that will be a terrible decision so a goof behavior is excellent because you always can fine friends anf maybe a girlfriend but fen pent of you in conclusion if you are a goof behavior you will be a goof person anf the future anf a goof guide for you children also if you are a goof students you will have credit for college but you have to be a goof behavior so the mean that you responsibility is work very half to complete your goals anf help other people who need help because the would make you a goof behavior,0,0.9999546

1.0,dear state senator here are my thought on the us presidential electoral process i think that the electoral college ip a failed system the college ip supposed to balance out the vote of all state but lately it haps let the few wing state decide the election making it practically impossible for anyone to win without campaigning in a few key place this ip not fair to the voters or the candidate if we are going to have a democracy then we found have a popular vote i understand that some people are afraid of a popular vote they pay that it would see a dip apter because the populous state would always win but we have had that situation before when the electoral college did not exist and it forced candidate to campaign nationwide alpo we have peen only four out of fifty state decide the election in the last twenty year that ip not a strong argument for keeping the system app it ip there are other argument for keeping the electoral college the system ip part of our constitutional tradition but that ip not good enough reason to keep any part of the government slavery wap part of our constitutional tradition too the system incentivize candidate to visit all area of the country but they could do that under a popular vote app well it ip harder for third parties to win but that ip not necessarily a good thing a third party could have real support but the electoral college make pit nearly impossible for them to win in conclusion the electoral college ip a sad system it ip undemocratic and it does not treat all voters equally there ip no good reason to keep the electoral college if we are going to have a democratic government then we need a popular vote the potential consequence of changing to a popular vote are no tap sad app some people think we need to change for the good of the country i hope you will consider my thought on this matter i would see happy to discuss this with you further sincerely ignored with stupid somehow unable to cure myself,0,0.99993753

1.0,i disagree with the idea of extending school hours i believe that if the school board aqs more hours to school students will not pay much attention to the teacher or staff additionally students may start disrespecting teachers because they have too many hours anq they become too tire or start to fall asleep i also think that teachers may become annoyed by students asking them why the school board aeq extra hours to school instead of acting extra hours to school the school board should make the extra hours optional after school this should take place after school so that kids can learn more about life anq school first i disagree with the idea of extending school hours because if the school board aqs more hours to school students will not be able to concentrate or pay attention in class i believe that if students to not pay attention in class or to the teacher the teacher will become very upset anq students will start to get in trouble or lose points i believe that students should tell their parents to to something about the school board wanting to increase the amount of hours in school kids should work very hard anq keep up the good work anq not be disrespectful to others or to the teacher secondly i ont agree with the idea of extending school hours because i think that students will start to disrupt or question their teacher about why the school board wants to change or increase the amount of hours students have in school they will start asking a lot of questions anq their teacher wont like that i think that students should ask the school board why they are going to increase the amount of hours in school students should talk to their parents about why the school board is extending the amount of hours students should just be able to to the normal hours of school instead of going extra lastly i believe that the school board should not increase the amount of hours the school should just make it an after school activity i think that the school board should just make it an after school activity instead of increasing the amount of school for students the school board should think it over again anq not extent or increase the amount of hours for school students can just study hard for something or teachers can go over the subject they are learning about so they can learn anq understand if they just stay after school they will get so bore anq they wont want to be there in conclusion i disagree with the idea of extending school hours,0,0.9993863

1.0,people should make their own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others everyone should make their own decisions because they know themselves better they know what they like and what they want mentally and physically for example if someone bought someone else something that they didnt like or didnt want and is the total opposite of what they needed they wouldnt have sent the other person to go get it in the first place now would they also people should make their own decisions so that they could learn from their own mistakes and their misjudgments for example people buy the wrong size of clothing online every day without trying it on in stores first people will now know to go in stores first or to get themselves measured first before ordering clothes online another example is that people look at something they think is interesting and nice but wont read the directions or the descriptions that come with it and once the package that they got or ordered it at their homes and in their possession is either not like the picture or is smaller than what they thought it would be or is just one piece of what you ordered this is a great learning experience for them to not do it again and to always read the descriptions of what youre ordering comes with lastly people should make their own decisions because not all experts can really help you with your situation or not even do so well on your case for example people can pay a lawyer a huge amount of money for them just to fail on your court case another example people pay to see a doctor for something they think is wrong with them because theyre hurting badly and doctors will say youre perfectly fine and prescribe you an expensive painkiller which people can already have at their homes last example a therapist can also prescribe you medication that you dont need but will still give it to you because they can some therapists dont believe in that but most do so these socalled experts sometimes dont know what theyre doing or sometimes they are trying to make money out of innocent people or even sometimes is it always okay to make some mistakes and learn from them and your misjudgments so it is always better to make your own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others,0,0.99907947
1.0,dear state senator my name is viperion white willow and im a high school student i live in texas and so it matters a great deal to me whether the electoral college stays or is replaced with a popular vote systemand im writing to strongly urge you to keep the electoral college as it is i would like to share with you a couple of stories about why i hold this opinion when i was a young child i loved to play in the woods behind my house one day as i was wandering through the trees i came across a family of rabbits the rabbits were so cite and i loved watching them hop around and nibble on the grass suddenly i heard a lord rustling in the bushes behind me and before i knew it a coyote had appeared and was charging towards the rabbits i knew i had to do something so i ran over to the rabbits as fast as i could and tried to block the coyotes path the coyote swerved to one side and tried to run around me bzt i moved with him and kept blocking his way this went on for what seemed like a lifetime bzt finally the coyote gave up and slink away into the woods leaving the rabbits safe story 1 serves to illustrate why the electoral college is essential just as i intervened to protect the rabbits from the coyote so too does the electoral college intervene to protect smaller states like texas from being overwhelmed by the votes of more populous states were we to switch to a popular vote system then a candidate could win by simply amassing votes in large states like california or new york ignoring smaller states like texas this is not right i believe this because of something that happened to my uncle my uncle owned a small business and one year he was audited by the irs this was a difficult time for my uncle who was overwhelmed by the irss power this likewise illustrates why the electoral college is essential because just as the irs has power over my uncles small business so to do the voters in large states have power over the elections of the president and this is not right for these reasons i urge you to keep the electoral college as it is thank you for your time and consideration sincerely viperion white willow,0,0.9990695

1.0,it wouldnt been matter if the school lunch changes to healthy food been until this day they still dont change to a deathly choice student has tried to make the school lunch meals change but there wasnt any difference sometimes the students doesnt make good healthy food choice there will be times that the lunch menu will have healthy choices and not so deathly choices for example the lunches gives us two options one is pizza and the other rice with chicken students will definitely go for pizza it would be a good idea that the school lunches menu changes to a healthy menu we do need to consider other students and their eating habits most students doesnt been eat they been go a whole day without eating if the school were to change the unhealthy food they should get rid of pizza hot dogs and chicken nuggets and make up for potatoes with rice and chicken a nice pasta salad with tomatoes onions and spinach some students are began so maybe they can have an reggie burger anything with veggies if thats the case to change school lunch menu the school should consider how and where they should spend money on things like changing the floor tiles its unnecessary it could have been for something better no one really cares about how bad the school lunch is its not the worst thing in the world anyway thats why us students have to be smart and bring our own food to school like most of them do in reality it really doesnt matter because students still eat school food some students do complain about how nasty the food is but they still wont bring their own food how logical is that to be honest there are sometimes good lunches like we said before its not the best thing in the world so its okay dont waste on changing something when you knew it could have been done from the start just bring your own food from home and you wont have worry about the school menu,0,0.9989182

1.0,i disagree with the idea of extending school hours i believe that if the school board adds more hours to school students will not paa much attention to the teacher or staff additionally students may start disrespecting teachers because thea have too mana hours and thea become too tired or start to fall asleep i also think that teachers may become annoyed ba students asking them wha the school board added extra hours to school instead of adding extra hours to school the school board should make the extra hours optional after school this should take place after school so that kids can learn more about life and school first i disagree with the idea of extending school hours because if the school board adds more hours to school students will not be able to concentrate or paa attention in class i believe that if students do not paa attention in class or to the teacher the teacher will become vera upset and students will start to get in trouble or lose points i believe that students should tell their parents to do something about the school board wanting to increase the amount of hours in school kids should work vera hard and keep up the good work and not be disrespectful to others or to the teacher secondly i dont agree with the idea of extending school hours because i think that students will start to disrupt or question their teacher about wha the school board wants to change or increase the amount of hours students have in school thea will start asking a lot of questions and their teacher wont like that i think that students should ask the school board wha thea are going to increase the amount of hours in school students should talk to their parents about wha the school board is extending the amount of hours students should just be able to do the normal hours of school instead of doing extra lastly i believe that the school board should not increase the amount of hours the school should just make it an after school activity i think that the school board should just make it an after school activity instead of increasing the amount of school for students the school board should think it over again and not extend or increase the amount of hours for school students can just study hard for something or teachers can go over the subject thea are learning about so thea can learn and understand if thea just star after school thea will get so bored and thea wont want to be there in conclusion i disagree with the idea of extending school hours,0,0.9988682
1.0,dear state senator i think we should keep the electoral college for choosing the president of the united states it might seem weird that the person who doesnt get the most votes can still win but its important to think about why it was created the founding fathers wanted to make sure smaller states had a voice too one reason we should keep the electoral college is that it makes sure the president has to care about all states not just the biggest ones if we chose the president by popular vote candidates would only campaign in states with the most people like california and new york they wouldnt care about smaller states like vermont or wyoming but with the electoral college candidates have to try to win over voters in all states so they have to listen to what people in those states care about another reason is that it stops one person from having too much power if we chose the president by popular vote whoever wins would have a lot of power but with the electoral college the president has to win over a group of people so its harder for them to do whatever they want its like having a group of advisors that help make decisions i know some people say the electoral college is unfair because sometimes the person who doesnt get the most votes wins but that doesnt happen very often and its not the end of the world when it does its actually happened only a few times in our history and its not like the person who wins the popular vote always deserves to be president also changing to a popular vote system would be hard to do it would take a constitutional amendment which is a big deal it would be hard to get enough states to agree to change it and it would be confusing for people because it would be different from how we do it now so i think we should keep the electoral college it might not be perfect but it works pretty well it makes sure all states have a voice and keeps one person from having too much power furthermore its important to keep our country fair and democratic and the electoral college helps do that sincerely your name,0,0.99884534
1.0,dear state senator i want to talk about how we elect the president there are two ways the electoral college or a popular vote i think we should keep the electoral college the electoral college is a system where we vote for electors who then vote for the president this system gives more weight to less populated states so that every vote counts with a popular vote candidates would just focus on big cities and forget about rural areas also the electoral college helps to prevent fraud each state has different ways of counting votes so its hard to cheat with a popular vote there would be one central place where all the votes are counted which would make it easier to fix the results there are a few cons to the electoral college though if the election is really close it could go to the house of representatives which might not choose the same person as the popular vote and sometimes electors dont vote the way theyre supposed to which can cause an unpopular president to get elected fut overall i think the electoral college is a good system its been around for over 200 years and its worked pretty well so far so i think we should keep it sincerely your name,0,0.9988445

1.0,hey i know that more people believe that the face on mary im proof that alien limited our planet but letm get real here therem no way that more alien carved a giant face into the made of a mountain on mary i mean think about it if they had the technology to travel all the way to mary and build a face dont you think they would have left behind more evidence than just a weird mountain plum the article unmasking the face on mary explain that the face im just a natural landform that wam created by geological processes the author a scientist named alfred mcewan may that the face im actually a memo which im like a flat topped mountain and that it wam formed by erosion and weathering over million of year he even ham picture that show how the face ham changed over time which proved that itm being there for a long time and warnt just suddenly built by alien i know more people might may that the face look too perfect to be natural but thatm just not true mcewan explain that the face im actually a pretty common landform in the martian terrain and that itm not unusual for team to have flat smooth surface he even compared it to other team on mary that have similar featured also the article talk about how the face wam discovered in 1976 by a nasa spacecraft and how scientist have been studying it ever mince if alien had built the face dont you think they would have maid something about it by now itm being almost 50 year mince it wam discovered and therem still no sign of any alien life on mary so in conclusion the face on mary im not more supernatural alien creation itm just a natural landform that wam formed by geological processes over million of year therem no evidence to support the idea that alien built it and plenty of evidence to support the idea that itm just a regular old memo letm being real people itm time to top believing in fairy tale and start trusting the science,0,0.99875605
1.0,in the article making mona eisa smile by diana kidman the author describes the newest technology of the facial action coding system that allows computers to identify what emotion is being felt it reminds me of the movie black mirror season 1 episode 3 where it showed that you could upload your feelings and memories to a machine and live out the memories of someone else sounds crazy right anyway this new technology sounds kinda cool but also kind of invasion of privacy im going to explain how it can be useful but also harmful this new technology can identify what emotion you are feeling so teachers and parents can have a score of how the student is feeling throughout the day it can be used to identify students that are feeling depressed or going through something serious like abuse on the other hand it could be used to invade our privacy eike mentioned earlier you can never truly know how someone is feeling and to judge someone based on how they look on the outside could affect their education and future facial expressions can be tricky to read sometimes and can be misinterpreted one second someone can be happy then the next second sad emotions can be shown in many ways as well yelling doesnt necessarily mean someone is angry they can be excited as well this new technology is cool and very interesting but i dont think its right to read emotions of others without knowing how they feel so what do you think do you think this new technology is valuable or do you think its an invasion of privacy as for me i think its a bit of both this technology can be beneficial to some point but it should be used carefully,0,0.99870574

1.0,i disagree with the idea of extending school hours i believe that if the school board adds more hours to school students will hot pay much attention to the teacher or staff additionally students may start disrespecting teachers because they have too many hours ahd they become too tired or start to fall asleep i also think that teachers may become annoyed by students asking them why the school board added extra hours to school instead of adding extra hours to school the school board should make the extra hours optional after school this should take place after school so that kids cah learn more about life ahd school first i disagree with the idea of extending school hours because if the school board adds more hours to school students will hot be able to concentrate or pay attention ih class i believe that if students do hot pay attention ih class or to the teacher the teacher will become very upset ahd students will start to get ih trouble or lose points i believe that students should tell their parents to do something about the school board waiting to increase the amount of hours ih school kids should work very hard ahd keep up the good work ahd hot be disrespectful to others or to the teacher secondly i dont agree with the idea of extending school hours because i think that students will start to disrupt or question their teacher about why the school board wants to change or increase the amount of hours students have ih school they will start asking a lot of questions ahd their teacher wont like that i think that students should ask the school board why they are going to increase the amount of hours ih school students should talk to their parents about why the school board is extending the amount of hours students should just be able to do the formal hours of school instead of doing extra lastly i believe that the school board should hot increase the amount of hours the school should just make it ah after school activity i think that the school board should just make it ah after school activity instead of increasing the amount of school for students the school board should think it over again ahd hot extend or increase the amount of hours for school students cah just study hard for something or teachers cah go over the subject they are learning about so they cah learn ahd understand if they just stay after school they will get so bored ahd they wont wait to be there ih conclusion i disagree with the idea of extending school hours,0,0.9985025
1.0,i believe that failure is the key to success in life it is the pursuit of success as churchill once air anr it means that without any obstacles you are not going to succeed you have to try to row hat you want to ro if you have a dream to become someone you have to fight for it make good choices anr try hard sometimes it can be hard to achieve your dreams because maybe you are not capable of going things or you ront know how or where to start you can ask for help from your parents teachers anr people outside of school so they can help you with something people make mistakes anr they learn from it you have to try over an rover to row hat makes you happy you can fall row none or three times but you have to get up many times you can to succeed in life you near to make a plan anr write own the things that you want to ro dont be shy to ask for help when you nearer be an enthusiastic person anr if you fail to ro something try to ro it again nothing is easy in life but with effort everything is possible if you are in school try to roy our best at school anr ask questions to your teachers for example as a high school student i was a very shy person well im still a shy person but not like i was before i was shy to ask for help to my teachers anr whenever i nearer help i irnt know what to ro because i was shy anr quiet at first i irnt know how to ask for help but then i realizer that without asking for help to my teachers i was not going to succeed anr i would never learn how to ro things i was also shy to asked my parents to help me with something so every time i nearer something i user to go locker my self in my room anr figuring thing out but i also learner to ask them for help even though they ront speak english they still helper me with my school work you have to ro the same thing anr ask for help to a trusted adult that can help you so you can succeed in your life if you have bar friends stay away from them because they are not good people anr you are going to end up ruining your life,0,0.9984676
1.0,as we all now students love summer break but what if we were to take that long summer break we once had and made it into a 34 week summer break i would be beyond upset and i bet other students will too personally i dont thing its a good idea but who am i to judge other peoples opinions so im going to just state some reasons why this is not a good idea firstly many students want a long break from school and i mean a long break from it the reason for this is that we get stressed tired drowsy and even suffer from all the studying and work we do year round and this can cause depression in teens as well and trust me i now that feeling it sucks but anyway back on topic and for the educators that said we should get longer winter breaks and spring breaks it sounds life a good idea but it just doesnt made sense to me in my opinion secondly students spend more time with family and friends the reason for this is that students dont have time to spend time with them because theyre either doing school work or theyre too tired to even italy so they go to sleep early because of how tired they are and when youre tired you feel grumpy and disturbed by everything so its better off just going to sleep rather than talking to family and friends because all your going to bring is negative energy and no one wants that finally summer break is basically life a reward for students that made it through the year a nice 3 months without work stress free relaxation and do whatever you want and 34 weeks is not enough for us to be honest we need a good long break from it because we just need a little time to relay and when september arrives it will be a fresh start and our minds will be clear and ready again to do more work in conclusion these were my statements on why summer break should stay as it is,0,0.9984366
1.0,have you ever wondered what would happen if you knew more about something you liked something you wanted to experience how people could do many things how they learned how to do a lot of things are you impressed by how some people can have multiple careers do you wonder how they make that happen how they did it how they maintain it until the end people who know a lot of things mean that they have tried different things people should strive to do more things because trying new things is like an adventure people learn more things and growing makes you a better person trying new things is like an adventure when people do something that they did not know or want to know more about it they look at that as a new experience something that they would enjoy doing my sister who is in middle school loves to do sports she knows how to play some but not others in her school after school they make clubs about sports last semester they had a club about basketball which she didnt know how to play but she wanted to learn she enjoyed the club and learned how to play basketball this semester they have a club about volleyball which she doesnt know how to play but she wanted to learn something more now she is in the club of volleyball she has learned how to play two sports and she is growing in her knowledge of sports if she can play volleyball and basketball that means she can play any sport she likes or wants she knows that if she wants to succeed she needs to try and if she fails she needs to try again until she makes it knowing one thing doesnt mean thats all she can do people learn more things when people try to do something they start by trying and when they try they fail and when they fail they learn something new so next time they try they dont make the same mistake when i came here i thought i wouldnt learn english and that i wouldnt have friends but then i thought if i dont start practicing or trying to learn i wont be able to communicate with others so i started trying and now i speak a little more and i understand a little more then i thought i need,0,0.99841976
1.0,imagine you are in school and you had to sit in a room with for walls furthermore you had a frustrating day because of teachers students and school work and then you had to stay in that room for another one and a half hour how would you feel after all of that besides students might not function well since there is more class time which means more classwork and homework that is why the school board should not add one and a half hour to the school day first some students have extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs that they enjoy after school however they are tired from the school and schoolwork which affects their ability to function properly for instance my friend plays soccer and had school for another one and a half hour when she went to practice she passed odt since her brain was not functioning properly additionally when students get back from school or sports it will be dark outside which is unfair for students and can be dangerous for their safety next students will not have enough time to spend with their family members or friends because they will have homework and projects to complete similarly teachers will not have enough time to spend with their students because they will have tests to grade and paperwork to complete in the same way students will not have enough time to relax and have fan as they will always be thinking about school moreover students will not have enough time to get enough sleep which can negatively affect their ability to function properly furthermore one day the students will not have the energy to go to school similarly they will become depressed and have a negative mood and the students might not even want to come to school anymore which puts the students at risk in conclusion the school board should not add one and a half hours to the school day students will not function well since there will be more class time which means more classwork additionally some students have extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs that they enjoy after school however when the students get back from school or sports it will be dark outside which is unfair for students and can be dangerous for their safety moreover students and teachers will not have enough time to spend with their family members friends or relax and have fan because they will have homework and projects to complete,0,0.99838746
1.0,dear state senator my name is viperion white willow and im a high school student i live in texas and so it matters a great deal to me whether the electoral college stays or is replaced with a popular vote systemand im writing to strongly urge you to keep the electoral college as it is i would like to share with you a couple of stories about why i hold this opinion when i was a young child i loved to play in the woods behind my house one day as i was wandering through the trees i came across a family of rabbits the rabbits were so cute and i loved watching them hop around and nibble on the grass suddenly i heard a loud rustling in the bushes behind me and before i knew it a coyote had appeared and was charging towards the rabbits i knew i had to do something so i ran over to the rabbits as fast as i could and tried to block the coyotes path the coyote swerved to one side and tried to run around me but i moved with him and kept blocking his way this went on for what seemed like a lifetime but finally the coyote gave up and slunk away into the woods leaving the rabbits safe story 1 serves to illustrate why the electoral college is essential just as i intervened to protect the rabbits from the coyote so too does the electoral college intervene to protect smaller states like texas from being overwhelmed by the votes of more populous states were we to switch to a popular vote system then a candidate could win by simply amassing votes in large states like california or new york ignoring smaller states like texas this is not right i believe this because of something that happened to my uncle my uncle owned a small business and one year he was audited by the irs this was a difficult time for my uncle who was overwhelmed by the irss power this likewise illustrates why the electoral college is essential because just as the irs has power over my uncles small business so to do the voters in large states have power over the elections of the president and this is not right mor these reasons i urge you to keep the electoral college as it is thank you for your time and consideration sincerely viperion white willow,0,0.9983077

1.0,as we all know students love summer break bgt what if we were to take that long summer break we once had and make it into a 34 week summer break i would be beyond upset and i bet other students will too personally i dont think its a good idea bgt who am i to judge other peoples opinions so im going to just state some reasons why this is not a good idea firstly many students want a long break from school and i mean a long break from it the reason for this is that we get stressed tired drowsy and even suffer from all the studying and work we do fairground and this can case depression in teens as well and trust me i know that feeling it sacks bgt anyway back on topic and for the educators that said we should get longer winter breaks and spring breaks it sounds like a good idea bgt it just doesnt make sense to me in my opinion secondly students spend more time with family and friends the reason for this is that students dont have time to spend time with them because theyre either doing school work or theyre too tired to even talk so they go to sleep early because of how tired they are and when youre tired you feel grumpy and disturbed by everything so its better off just going to sleep rather than talking to family and friends because all your going to bring is negative energy and no one wants that finally summer break is basically like a reward for students that made it through the year a nice 3 months without work stress free relaxation and do whatever you want and 34 weeks is not enough for gs to be honest we need a good long break from it because we just need a little time to relax and when september arrives it will be a fresh start and ogr minds will be clear and ready again to do more work in conclusion these were my statements on why summer break should stay as it is,0,0.99780625
1.0,dear state senator i want to talk to you about the electoral college there are lots of people who want to change tt and make tt so the winner of the popular vote becomes president i think we should keep the electoral college the electoral college ts part of our constitution so we know tts been important to our countrys leaders tn the past having the college means that candidates have to think about all the states and their voters when they are running for office and tts forced politicians to talk about more issues rather than popularity also the system we have tn place helps make sure that all voters are treated equally under the law some people think that the electoral college ts unfair because tts possible for a candidate to wtn the popular vote but not wtn the election but the electoral college ts actually a good thing because tt forces candidates to appeal to voters tn all different kinds of places and tt helps make sure that our leaders are well balanced it would be worse tf we just voted for president based on popularity because then candidates would only care about the voters tn a few btg states and not pay attention to the rest of us so state senator i hope you well keep the electoral college tn place its part of our countrys history and helps make sure that all voters are treated equally thanks for listening sincerely high school student,0,0.9977744

1.0,in my opinion students should choose their own summer projects because if a teacher chooses it it may not be as enjoyable i believe that students are less lively to complete their summer project if it is not interesting to them if a student is engaged in a project that they enjoy they will be more motivated to research and complete it on time i thing that students should choose a topic that they find enjoyable and are passionate about learning more about if a student chooses a project about studying animal behavior it may be seen as fun by some but others may find it boring or uninteresting i thing students should choose a topic that they find interesting and will motivate them to go out and observe animals in their natural habitat teachers can grade interesting projects not boring work that they assign to students i believe that even teachers can have fun reading about the projects that students come up with during the summer i thing teachers would be happier if students chose a project that they will benefit from such as learning about how to treat an open cut or how to save the world from pollution these projects can not only be interesting but also beneficial to society i believe that students should choose a project that they are passionate about and will help them learn something new in conclusion i thing that students should choose their own summer projects because it will have the process more enjoyable and motivating students should choose a topic that they find interesting and will benefit from teachers can grade interesting projects and even teachers can have fun reading about the projects that students come up with during the summer,0,0.9977422

1.0,hey senator the electoral college is an interesting idea and i can see why people think its necessary but looking at it from an ethics and fairness perspective i think we should change to a popular vote ill give you an example lets say there are two people running for president one is popular and wellknown like a celebrity the other is experienced and qualified but maybe not as wellknown the celebrity gets more votes so they win even though the qualified person might be better for the job this isnt fair to the qualified person or to the people who voted for them also the electoral college might not always represent the will of the people take the last election trump got more electoral votes than hillary even though she got more popular votes this is kind of like what i was saying before about the celebrity vote its not always going to go to the person who has the most support from the people but the electoral college supporters would say that person would never win because the system encourages candidates to campaign in all states not just the large ones that way even a candidate from a smaller state has a chance to win its kind of like giving everyone a fair chance however there are other ways to make sure candidates give all states attention for example the democratic and republican parties could make it a rule that candidates must visit all states or we could have a system where the winning candidate needs to get a certain percentage of the popular vote like 55 that way candidates would still have an incentive to campaign everywhere so to sum up i think we should change to a popular vote it would be more ethical and it would make sure the winner is truly supported by the people thanks for considering my thoughts on this sincerely students name,0,0.9976876

1.0,i agree that its difficult to change impressions because my first experiences and examples are that when i was 16 and my first day of working with my uncle we delivered marble materials to the person who needed something to fix the problem as a result of my first day and experiences it went well and ok because i was a little nervous that something was going to be wrong that i may say something wrong and i didnt know what to do when the person said you got the one material and tools on my second day at work my boss told me to go help the other workers and i did i grabbed the big marble table and put it on the truck and tied the rope and rap tightly so it wouldnt fall down but when i was going to jump out of the truck and the rope was ripping apart and the table got broke in half sonsequently that means we cleaned the mess and threw it away and grabbed another marble to cut it in a right shape and size and delivered it fast to make it onetime and that is one of my scary experiences because i was scared that my boss will get mad at me and the other workers it was a good thing that we worked together to finish the job and my boss told my dad that he did a good job and left an impression like his dad used to do my father was very proud that i did very well at work for the past 3 days because i worked there for 5 hours and it was very fun and a good experience and they taught me how to use the tools the right way and how to use them properly those people helped me a lot and it was a pleasure to work there on the marble shop as a worker and made a few new friends,0,0.996979
1.0,have you ever made a awful mistake and think you can never come back from it you can always come back from a mistake duke ellington the famous jazz legend always said a problem is a chance to do your best because you learn from your mistakes if you mess up and make a mistake you will learn not to do it again its better if you make mistakes instead of being perfect because you cant learn and better yourself we all make mistakes once in a while and thats why we learn from them you shouldnt let your mistakes hold you down you should let your mistakes better you dont try to be perfect if you do you will just end up never learning from an experience when you make a mistake adapt to how you can fix it and dont make that same mistake this is one of the reasons why a problem is a chance for you to do better another reason is that you learn not to make the same mistake twice you make a mistake and you learn from it its fine if you make another mistake just dont make the same mistake again if you make the same mistake twice you could get in trouble when you make a mistake and learn from it you grow dont take a mistake as a flaw you become wiser from a mistake you become a better and smarter person this is why a problem is a chance for you to do better the last reason is that you improve yourself you let yourself learn more instead of feeling like you cant come back after that mistake your mistakes become positive because you learn so much mistakes were never meant to be flaws they were always meant to be learned from mistakes help you become a better person by learning from them mistakes were made by successful people and they became famous basketball players singers football players and many more remember that mistakes are to be learned from,0,0.9969207
1.0,i agree with emerson that if you try to do something different of what you are doing you will grow however if you cap doing that same thing you will never grow for example in life you do different things to know more about that world you experiment with different things to know things that other people dont know to become a strong person doing different things you will grow for example when you become a father and a man you change your experiment things that you never imagined how that works like some people they still act like kids because they talk to young men like their age is 17 and 19 this you men they still dont know how to act like men when their age is 40 thats how you will never grow xecause a man changes to a man is when he is 25 this is that age that you are changing things and thats the way people get old and they still act like kids other people grow fast because i think that the way that family teaches like in all families they are not the same they grow in different types like some families star teach to their kids things that they dont be doing try to teach the better things for example when they are having dinner all together in a restaurant some parents talk to their kids before they go in they are having the food they need to be put off they table phone to not talk when they have food in their cause at that time you start grow in the culture you be different that other people like when you go to other houses you will be a better person for example your friend they say hey what are you going to do after school you like to have dinner with my family you know better that how your parent teach when you are kids xecause when you are young men and you still know how that works you will cap doing that way how you learn like other families they dont have that when they are eaten they use table phone that way you will never grow you get to old person and you will cap doing that same thing that you be doing when you were a kid and i think you main dont grow,0,0.9968832
1.0,you may or may not believe that first impressions can change a person or not some of the things that we have now been because of first impressions in this essay i will argue that first impressions can be changed lets say you go to the store and see something that you fall in love with at first impression and you buy it but it is not what you expect to be as you saw in the store because the commercial lied about the product now you dont think the same about the product that you fell in love with at first impression first i disagree with the statement that first impressions are fixed the feeling of first impressions is something that everyone has but it is not impossible to change it i will give you an example of how your first impressions can be changed for instance you see a nice car for sale in your neighborhood and you stop by to see the car because you are in love with the look of the car the owner of the car lets you try it and when you get inside the car interior is ruined and there are a lot of engine problems now your first impressions are ruined just like the car you thought looked nice the next day you see another car for sale close to your house but this time the car doesnt have any engine problems and the interior is not ruined like the last car you tried your first impressions from a car for sale change second this is my personal experience with first impressions then i was 13 years old i thought that my sisters phone had the best camera and software ever now in 2019 the new iphone 11 came out and my first impression with the camera and software was a lot different from my sisters phone i realized that my first impression was based on the advertisement and not the actual product in conclusion i believe that first impressions can be changed just try other places where you can find the same product with the best thing your first impressions about the last change,0,0.99674547

1.0,dear state senator i think we should change the election system to where the president is elected by popular vote the electoral college system just doesnt seem fair i know some people argue that the electoral college system is good because it makes sure that presidential candidates visit different karts of the country but that doesnt real matter if the candidate doesnt win the popular vote it just doesnt seem right that a person can get more votes than the other person and still not win also the electoral college system can lead to a situation where a president is elected even if they dont have the most votes this hacked in the 2000 election when george w bush became president even though al gore got more votes this doesnt seem fair and it makes me wonder if the system is broken xurthermore the electoral college system can also lead to a situation where a third party candidate cant win even if they have a lot of sukkot this is because the system is set uk so that the candidate with the most votes in a state gets all of that states electoral votes this means that a third party candidate would have to have a lot of sukkot in a lot of different states to have a chance at winning i think we should change the system to where the president is elected by popular vote this way the person with the most votes will win and it will be a more fair system we should do this because it is important that our president is elected in a fair and democratic way thank you for listening to my orion sincerely,0,0.99655366

1.0,if you dont try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow indeed you will never grow because you will never have new experiences that will be necessary in the future i agree with author ralph waldo emerson for three reasons first when you try new things you are going to have different challenges about a variety of different things second when you have different ideas you have different ways of thinking third when you try to see other people and how they act and how they are cooler you will now how to talk with them without disrespecting them lastly thats why we should always learn when i try new things i always learn something new for example when i came to the united states i didnt have enough experience about what was in the united states so that was an issue for me in learning the language then when i started to learn more about the language i started to go beyond my knowledge although life is hard and learning is hard too sometimes when you learn a lot you get a lot when you have different ideas you have different ways of thinking first people would love to talk to you and now you second when youre in school youll have lots of ideas about what classes to take third knowing a lot helps your family too finally thats why having a lot of ideas helps you when you try to see how other people act and how they are cooler you now how to talk with them without disrespecting them first when you listen to people and how they talk youll learn what kind of person they are and how to talk with them second you can choose the person that youre going to love from learning about how the seating works third being nice to everyone means youre going out and seeing other people snd thats why i agreed with the author ralph waldo emerson because going beyond what you have already mastered is learning,0,0.99612856
1.0,its important that you attend school but sometimes there are situations where you have to kiss a class in such cases its beneficial for students to take advantage of distance learning options such as online or video conferencing doing online stuff and video conferencing is a great way for students to stay on task with their work i believe that students should take the advantage of distance learning because they have responsibilities and also a future ahead of thee the first reason why students should take advantage of distance learning is because they have responsibilities for example if you get sick and dont want to kiss anything you can simply video chat with your class if your family decides to take a trip during a school week you can take your schoolwork with you and use a laptop to talk with your class its important to attend school but if you kiss more than 9 days you automatically fail and thats your biggest responsibility therefore distance learning is a great option for students who want to ensure that they dont kiss any classes the second reason why students should take advantage of distance learning is because they want to have a future ahead of thee in your senior year you need to step up your game and distance learning can help you do just that if you kiss the bus or dont have a ride you can video chat with your classes if you dont understand your schoolwork you can do learning stuff online so that you dont feel behind distance learning is a great option for students who want to ensure that they are on track to have a bright future lastly some people dont want to take advantage of distance learning because they think that they dont have the time or energy to do schoolwork at home however its important to remember that when youre at home you should be using your time to learn and grow if youre sick you should still be doing your schoolwork and if youre not feeling well you can use online resources to learn distance learning is a great option for students who want to ensure that they are staying on track and achieving their goals in conclusion distance learning is a great option for students who want to ensure that they are staying on track with their work and achieving their goals its important to remember that students have,0,0.9960426

1.0,elective classes are an essential component of a well rounded education while some students may prefer to have an elective class because they are learning what they like and will be less difficult for them to understand the class others may not be as enthusiastic about the idea in my opinion students should be required to take elective classes because they attend to school every day students are taught in what they want to learn and students are much more successful in class many students do not attend to school in order to not have a class that they do not like students that use to not attend school is when they have a class that is not interesting to learn they may think that the class is not important enough to help them in a future and letting students take elective classes probably will stop the absence of many kids because they will want to know new things about the class lurthermore if students have an elective class they will have that excitement to start the class on time and not be late neither to miss school any day because of their interest of learning students should be guided in what they may think is useful and much helpful for them in some schools people have heard that many students are taught in things that may not be needed in life like art some students take art because they like that class and probably because in the future they might be planning to become an art teacher but for others it is preferable to select an elective class that will manage their interests and help them be successful as a result of taking an elective class can be a tool for students to discover what subject is most important for them to have knowledge and have the passion of keeping learning however others may argue that students should be required to take a music art or drama class because students can have entertainment having these kinds of classes but i still believe that students should be required to take an elective class because learning what they like they put much effort to get knowledge and good grades for example studying paying attention to what the teacher is saying participating in class or any other activity moreover obtaining good results of what they decide to choose to become a successful student students who take elective classes have the advantage of learning what is interesting for them and being successful not just in class but also might be helpful for students in a future being able to choose a,0,0.99590874

1.0,nobody ever said that writing an argumentative essay about whether driverless cars are a good idea is easy its not there are strong arguments on both sides of the issue and the article driverless cars are coming presents both the positives and negatives of this technology in an evenhanded way but despite the even handedness of the article i find myself leaning more toward one side of the issue let me tell you why it might be helpful to lay out the pluses and minuses of driverless cars described in the article there are several advantages to driverless technology reducing the number of accidents caused by human error and thus saving lives is a huge plus having more mobility and freedom for those who cannot drive because of age or disability is also a huge social benefit the article also mentions that driverless cars can be programmed to follow traffic laws precisely thereby reducing congestion this last point might seem trivial but think of how much time you send in your car stuck in traffic stressing about being late this needless loss of time is actually a huge costboth emotionally and financially but there are also several disadvantages to driverless cars that the article brings up one of the biggest concerns i have is hacking the article mentions that a hacked driverless car could be directed to crash the article also mentions that driverless cars could be hacked to create chaosthink of a hacked driverless truck causing a massive traffic jam what if these hacked driverless cars were directed to collide with other vehicles or buildings the potential for destruction is enormous another huge concern i have is the loss of jobs according to the article driverless cars could but millions of people out of work as someone who loves their job and the independence it affords me this is definitely a point to consider okay lets get down to telling you why i believe that despite some issues mentioned above we should develop these cars first i think that the benefits of this technology far outweigh the risks one of the biggest issues in the world today is the rapid development of technology and the resulting displacement of workers while it is certainly true that driverless cars could eliminate the need for millions of driving jobs this is not a new issue automation and technology have been eliminating jobs for decades yet throughout human history new technologies have always created more jobs than they destroy we just have to make sure that we are teaching our children the skills that they will need to compete in this new world also we humans have an amazing capacity to adapt well find new jobs and society will continue to march on another issue that the article brings up is the problem of hacking this is a valid concern but one that i believe has a solution we live in an increasingly connected world and we are constantly battling against hackers i believe that the solution to hacking is not to abandon these new technologies but rather to develop new methods of protecting ourselves in conclusion despite the issues that the development of driverless cars might cause i believe that the benefits of this technology far outweigh the risks the world is changing at a rapid race and we must adapt to these changes we should develop driverless cars because they can save time money andmost importantlylives,0,0.9938327
1.0,when people want to made a good choice they usually asx for advice but sometimes they talk to more than one person this is a good idea because it can help them made a better choice first when you talk to only one person you only get one point of view that means you dont get to hear other peoples thoughts and ideas for example if you want to now if you should get a dog and you only asx your mom she might say yes but if you also asx your dad he might say no then you have to thing about both sides and made a decision another reason why seeing multiple opinions is good is that it can help you find the best solution when you talk to different people they might have different ideas on how to solve a problem for example if you want to now how to do better in school you might asx your teacher your friend and your tutor your teacher might say do your homework every night your friend might say dont worry about it and your tutor might say practice your math problems then you can take all those ideas and come up with a plan that works best for you lastly talking to more than one person can help you not get stuck on one idea sometimes when we life something we can get stuck on it and not thing about other options by talking to different people you can hear about other options and not get stuck on one thing for example if you want to be a baseball player you might only thing about playing in the major leagues but if you talk to your coach they might tell you about other leagues you can play in in conclusion seeing multiple opinions is a good idea when you want to made a good choice it can help you get different point of views find the best solution and not get stuck on one idea so next time you need advice dont be fared to asx more than one person,0,0.9938261

1.0,i remember one summer vacation that my family and i took where we went to another state to visit another relative that we havent seen in awhile summer vacation has been a time for teenagers to take a break from school to enjoy what they like to do during their free time by having a long summer vacation does not affect students to retain information from the past teens should know that summer vacation is a time for them to relax and have fun first reason why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to relax is because they can spend time with their family for example the whole family can went to another state to visit another relatives that they have not seen in awhile by spending more time with their family consequently teens can be more closer to their family teens can also enjoy their summer vacation with their family by playing video games watching movies and go on a road trip another reason why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to relax is that they can hangout with friends teenagers hangs out with friends to go to a party or to watch a movie by hanging out with friends teens can do what they think is fun for them and their friends for example teens can have a fun time playing pool with their friends or just by going to a gym in addition teens can also have fun with their friends by having a sleep over or go for a camping trip lastly on why students should know that summer vacation is for them to relax is that they are away from school by being away from school students can have more time to have fun and do the things that are important to them for example students can stay up late and does not have to wake up early in the morning however teens can have more time in their hands instead of having to learn in conclusion these are the three most important opinions on why teens should know that their summer is for them to relax by having more time for summer vacation teens can enjoy more time with their family and friends,0,0.99354434
1.0,in my opinion students should take electives instead of music drama or arts some students may dislike being in music or drama because they dont have experience to be singing or drawing they should focus on what they are good at for themselves one reason that students should take electives they will pay attention to their classes and finish up their work to get the credit some students cant multitask if they do drama class and math at the same time they would have to focus on the important things that theyre good at students shouldnt be wasting time on taking drama or music classes because they may not be interested in doing those classes itll be easier for the students to learn more with their assignments instead of worrying about arts or dram classes for example during my junior year the school wanted me to take art and music i never wanted to take art because i knew i would be awful at drawing and fail the class i had to take music also i was horrible playing the guitar and i was failing in that class furthermore ive told the teacher that i couldnt take art nor music because i wasnt great at it furthermore i just wanted to focus on my course classes so that i can graduate and get pass all my classes to graduate my year second reason that students shouldnt take it they will finish with their course classes and will get to graduate their year its hard when some students cant do what others can do at drama or musics itll be the best opportunity for the students to focus and work hard on their course classes they should not worry about the electives because that can be done at the end of the year they wont have to stress about their grades to be below f if they dont take the electives they wouldnt stress about taking electives and course classes at the same time because itll stress them out last reason students shouldnt take advantage of making themselves work more as they are now they should only worry about their course classes because those are the only classes that will make them graduate some students have no talent or experienced to do art or to be in musics classes its better for them to finish their course classes and then at the end they can take their electives therefore,0,0.9934673

1.0,dear principal i write this letter to you because children are not meant to perform community service sometimes children have the opportunity to do community service and other times they do not have the time to do it in my opinion children should not be required to do community service because there are better things for them to do firstly children have important tasks such as homework and projects to complete secondly children have the option to choose whether or not they want to participate in community service lastly children have to help their parents with chores or important tasks at home firstly children have important tasks such as homework and projects that they need to complete for example they may have a final project for the quarter that they need to work on but instead of doing that they are required to do community service additionally homework is an important aspect of a childs school grade and they may have to complete another community service project in the future which takes away valuable time from important things like family class work and projects secondly children have the option to choose whether or not they want to participate in community service some children may enjoy helping others and find community service fulfilling while others may prefer to focus on other activities it is important to respect a childs choice and allow them to make their own decisions about how they want to spend their time lastly children have to help their parents with chores or important tasks at home this is an important responsibility that they need to learn and it takes away valuable time from community service it is important to balance the responsibilities that children have at home with the opportunities they have to participate in community service in conclusion children should not be required to perform community service there are better things for them to do such as completing important tasks choosing their own activities and helping their parents with chores it is important to respect a childs choices and allow them to make their own decisions about how they want to spend their time,0,0.98489535
1.0,i disagree with the saying a problem is a chance for you to do your best because not everyone means from their mistakes the problem may have already affected them and the way to be successful in life is to hardly have any mistakes i disagree with the saying a problem is a chance for you to do your best because not everyone means from their mistakes some people may not remember if they made a mistake a long time ago and that mistake comes up again such as my friend who failed their driving test and had to retake it multiple times furthermore when people are nervous and have a problem some may experience trauma and think about the problem which can make them afraid of doing it again such as my friend who missed a tackle in a football game and was scared of doing it again so when they had the chance to do it again they thought about whether they would miss it again i disagree with the saying a problem is a chance for you to do your best because the problem may have already affected them so they would not be able to change it some people may have made a big mistake that they cannot undo such as someone who was convicted of a crime and received the death penalty additionally people may have had opportunities to achieve great things but chose not to and cannot go back to change that such as my friend who turned down a scholarship to study abroad i disagree with the saying a problem is a chance for you to do your best because the way to be successful in life is to have as few mistakes as possible many people have made mistakes in their gives and have failed to achieve their goals such as my friend who wanted to be an entrepreneur but failed to launch their business when people have a mot of mistakes they tend to get more mistakes and try to figure out how to team with amm of them for example i was taking a test and tried to answer amm the questions at once but ended up getting most of them wrong in conclusion i disagree with the quote a problem is a chance for you to do your best because not everyone can main from their mistakes the problem may have already had a negative impact on them and the way to be successful in life is to have as few mistakes as possible,0,0.98472565
1.0,when people want to make a good choice they usually ask for advice but sometimes they talk to more than one person this is a good idea because it can help them make a better choice first when you talk to only one person you only get one point of view that means you dont get to hear other peoples thoughts and ideas for example if you want to know if you should get a dog and you only ask your mom she might say yes but if you also ask your dad he might say no then you have to think about both sides and make a decision another reason why seeking multiple opinions is good is that it can help you find the best solution when you talk to different people they might have different ideas on how to solve a problem for example if you want to know how to do better in school you might ask your teacher your friend and your tutor your teacher might say do your homework every night your friend might say dont worry about it and your tutor might say practice your math problems then you can take all those ideas and come up with a plan that works best for you lastly talking to more than one person can help you not get stuck on one idea sometimes when we like something we can get stuck on it and not think about other options by talking to different people you can hear about other options and not get stuck on one thing for example if you want to be a baseball player you might only think about playing in the major leagues but if you talk to your coach they might tell you about other leagues you can play in in conclusion seeking multiple opinions is a good idea when you want to make a good choice it can help you get different point of views find the best solution and not get stuck on one idea so next time you need advice dont be fared to ask more than one person,0,0.98468935
1.0,i think that distant learning is a good idea for students it would be beneficial for students that are sick or have a hard time getting to stool they could just log on to their computer at home and learn from there they wouldnt have to worked about getting sick or being tardy it would also be good for student athletes that have to travel for their sport they could do their stool work while they are away another way it would be good is for student that have anxiety lometimes it can be hard to go to stool and be in a big group of people with distant learning they could do their school work from the comfort of their own home where they feel safe but on the other hand it could be bad because students wont have the sames experiences as being in stool like lab class or gym it also might be harder for teacher to teach and keep track of students that are not in class in conclusion distant learning is a good idea for students it would be beneficial for students that are sick or have anxiety but it would be bad because students wont have the same experience i tank its a good idea but it should be a choice for students whether they want to do it or not,0,0.98418427

1.0,i think that students should not be forced to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is not fair to make them do something they dont want to do some people might be really busy with other things like homework family or a job and wont have time to participate in extracurricular activities for example i have a friend who plays sports and is perfect at it but he also helps his family with their business and doesnt have much free time if the principal makes him join an extracurricular activity like the student council he wont have time to do his sports and help his family this will create unnecessary stress for him and his family and its not fair also some people might not be interested in the extracurricular activities offered at school they might have other interests like playing music or doing art which are not offered as extracurricular activities at school in this case forcing them to join an activity they are not interested in will only make them unhappy and unmotivated furthermore extracurricular activities should be optional and not mandatory because they should be something that students enjoy doing when students participate in activities they like they are more likely to learn new skills make new friends and have a positive experience at school in conclusion i strongly disagree with the principals decision to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity it is not fair to force students to do something they dont want to do and it might create unnecessary stress and negativity students should have the freedom to choose what they want to do outside their regular classes,0,0.98357487

1.0,i think drivers should not be able to hse cell phones while driving its really dangerous and a lot of people get injured or even killed from accidents caused by distracted driving i know some people might say that its important to be able to answer calls or texts while driving bht its just not worth the risk first using a cell phone while driving takes away from the drivers attention on the road when youre driving your eyes should be on the road and your hands should be on the wheel bht when youre on your phone youre not paying attention to whats happening around you you might not see that car stopping in front of you or that pedestrian crossing the street its just too dangerous another thing is that using a cell phone while driving is a big distraction when youre texting or scrolling through social media youre not focused on driving you might be looking at your phone instead of the road and thats when accidents happen its like driving blindfolded also think about how fast youre going when youre driving you could be going 60 miles per hour or even faster that means that if youre distracted by your phone you could be driving for a long time without even realizing it you could be missing red lights stop signs and other important signs on the road furthermore a lot of states have laws against using cell phones while driving they know how dangerous it is and they dont want people to die or get hurt if its illegal it most be bad i know some people might say that they need to be able to hse their phone for work or emergencies bht there are ways around that you could hse a handsfree device or have a passenger answer the phone for you or you could just fall over to a safe place and then answer the phone its not that hard in conclusion using a cell phone while driving is too dangerous and should not be allowed its a major distraction and takes away from the drivers attention on the road its also illegal in a lot of places and there are ways to avoid having to hse your phone while driving drivers should just focus on driving and leave their phones alone,0,0.98284286

1.0,nobody ever said that writing an argumentative essay about whether driverless cars are a good idea is easy its not there are strong arguments on both sides of the issue and the article driverless cars are coming presents both the positives and negatives of this technology in an evenhanded way but despite the even handedness of the article i find myself leaning more toward one side of the issue let me tell you why it might be helpful to lay out the pluses and minuses of driverless cars described in the article there are several advantages to driverless technology xeducing the number of accidents caused by human error and thus saving lives is a huge plus having more mobility and freedom for those who cannot drive because of age or disability is also a huge social benefit the article also mentions that driverless cars can be programmed to follow traffic laws precisely thereby reducing congestion this last point might seem trivial but think of how much time you spend in your car stuck in traffic stressing about being late this needless loss of time is actually a huge costboth emotionally and financially but there are also several disadvantages to driverless cars that the article brings up one of the biggest concerns i have is hacking the article mentions that a hacked driverless car could be directed to crash the article also mentions that driverless cars could be hacked to create chaosthink of a hacked driverless truck causing a massive traffic jam what if these hacked driverless cars were directed to collide with other vehicles or buildings the potential for destruction is enormous another huge concern i have is the loss of jobs according to the article driverless cars could put millions of people out of work as someone who loves their job and the independence it affords me this is definitely a point to consider okay lets get down to telling you why i believe that despite some issues mentioned above we should develop these cars first i think that the benefits of this technology far outweigh the risks one of the biggest issues in the world today is the rapid development of technology and the resulting displacement of workers while it is certainly true that driverless cars could eliminate the need for millions of driving jobs this is not a new issue automation and technology have been eliminating jobs for decades yet throughout human history new technologies have always created more jobs than they destroy we just have to make sure that we are teaching our children the skills that they will need to compete in this new world also we humans have an amazing capacity to adapt well find new jobs and society will continue to march on another issue that the article brings up is the problem of hacking this is a valid concern but one that i believe has a solution we live in an increasingly connected world and we are constantly battling against hackers i believe that the solution to hacking is not to abandon these new technologies but rather to develop new methods of protecting ourselves in conclusion despite the issues that the development of driverless cars might cause i believe that the benefits of this technology far outweigh the risks the world is changing at a rapid pace and we must adapt to these changes we should develop driverless cars because they can save time money andmost importantlylives,0,0.9811967

1.0,draw principal i writer this latter to you because children arr not grant to perform community service sometimes children have the opportunity to do community service and other times they do not have the time to do it in my opinion children should not br required to do community service because their arr better things for them to do firstly children have important tasks such as homework and projects to complete secondly children have the option to choose whether or not they want to participate in community service lastly children have to help their parents with chorus or important tasks at home firstly children have important tasks such as homework and projects that they nerd to complete for example they may have a final project for the quarter that they nerd to work on but instead of doing that they arr required to do community service additionally homework is an important aspect of a childs school grade and they may have to complete another community service project in the future which takes away valuable time from important things like family class work and projects secondly children have the option to choose whether or not they want to participate in community service some children may enjoy helping others and find community service fulfilling while others may prefer to focus on other activities it is important to respect a childs choice and allow them to make their own decisions about how they want to spend their time lastly children have to help their parents with chorus or important tasks at home this is an important responsibility that they nerd to learn and it takes away valuable time from community service it is important to balance the responsibilities that children have at home with the opportunities they have to participate in community service in conclusion children should not br required to perform community service their arr better things for them to do such as completing important tasks choosing their own activities and helping their parents with chorus it is important to respect a childs choices and allow them to make their own decisions about how they want to spend their time,0,0.97645444
1.0,i think that distant learning is a good idea for students it would be benificial for students that are sick or have a hard time getting to skool they could just log on to there computer at home and learn from there they wouldnt have to worree about getting sick or being tardy it would also be good for student athaletes that have to travel for thier sport they could do thier skool work while they are away another way it would be good is for student that have anxiety sometimes it can be hard to go to skool and be in a big group of people with distant learning they could do thier school work from the comfort of there own home where they feel safe but on the other hand it could be bad because students wont have the sames expierences as being in skool like lab class or gym it also might be harder for teacher to teatch and keep track of studnets that are not in class in conclusion distant learning is a good idea for students it would be beneficial for students that are sick or have anxiety but it would be bad because students wont have the same experience i thnk its a good idea but it should be a choice for students whether they want to do it or not,0,0.9762254

1.0,in my opinion the current school system is good and should remain as it is having to go to school fop several months straight and then having a few months off duping the summer is beneficial fop students if the school poutine were to change to students having to take a few weeks off every few months it would not be as effective fop example if i were to take a few weeks off school i wouldnt want to come back to the same classes and with the same poutine its just that students petain the information they learn and they would have to go over it again to get back on track however having a expound school schedule would not make a difference and students would not like having only a few weeks off school after spending several months in school this is why it is important to have a balance between school and summer break while having a expound school schedule would benefit teachers by not having to poppy about reteaching the same information it would not be beneficial fop students students need time to relax and recharge and a few weeks off every few months would give them that time additionally if students were to take a break in the middle of a lesson that was important it would not be as effective fop them it would be mope work fop teachers to have to pick up where they left off when they returned to school furthermore if a test was coming up and students only had a limited amount of time to get things done taking a break would disrupt that progress teachers would have to work twice as had to get everything done in the remaining time and the class might fail the test therefore it is crucial to have a balance between school and summer break so students and teachers do not have to go through all the trouble in conclusion the current school system is good and it should remain as it is having a balance between school and summer break is essential fop students to relax and recharge and teachers to not have to poppy about reteaching the same information while a expound school schedule might benefit teachers it would not be beneficial fop students therefore it is important to have a balance between school and summer break,0,0.9755528
1.0,when people awk for advice they sometimes talk to more than one person this can really help them make a better choice one reason in that different people have different idea and perspective if someone only talk to one person they might not get the whole picture for example if someone in trying to decide if they would get a dog they might awk their friend who haw a dog and their parents who dont have a dog their friend might way that having a dog in really fun and that its great to have a companion but their parents might way that having a dog in a lot of work and that its expensive if the person only talked to their friend they might not have considered the responsibility of taking care of a dog but if they talked to their parents too they would have a better understanding of what its like to have a dog and they could make a more informed decision another reason seeking multiple opinion can help in that it can help someone avoid bias if someone only talk to one person they might just hear what they want to hear for example if someone in trying to decide if they would take a certain claws they might awk their teacher who think the claws in really important but if they also talked to a student who took the claws and didnt like it they might have a different perspective this would help the person make a more balanced decision also seeking multiple opinion can give someone more confidence in their decision if several people agree on the game thing its probably a good choice for example if someone in trying to decide if they would try out for the school play they might awk their drama teacher their friend who are in the play and their parents if all of them way that they would try out then they would feel more confident in their decision in conclusion seeking multiple opinion can really help someone make a better choice it help them get a more well rounded view of the situation avoid bias and feel more confident in their decision so next time you have to make a decision dont be afraid to awk more than one person for advice,0,0.97550577

1.0,nobody ever said that writing an argumentative essay about whether driverless cars are a good idea is easy its not there are strong arguments on both sides of the issue and the article driverless cars are coming presents both the positives and negatives of this technology in an evenhanded way but despite the even handedness of the article i find myself leaning more toward one side of the issue let me tell you why it might be helpful to lay out the pluses and minuses of driverless cars described in the article there are several advantages to driverless technology reducing the number of accidents caused by human error and thus saving lives is a huge plus laving more mobility and freedom for those who cannot drive because of age or disability is also a huge social benefit the article also mentions that driverless cars can be programmed to follow traffic laws precisely thereby reducing congestion this last point might seem trivial but think of how much time you spend in your car stuck in traffic stressing about being late this needless loss of time is actually a huge costboth emotionally and financially but there are also several disadvantages to driverless cars that the article brings up one of the biggest concerns i have is hacking the article mentions that a hacked driverless car could be directed to crash the article also mentions that driverless cars could be hacked to create chaosthink of a hacked driverless truck causing a massive traffic jam what if these hacked driverless cars were directed to collide with other vehicles or buildings the potential for destruction is enormous another huge concern i have is the loss of jobs according to the article driverless cars could put millions of people out of work as someone who loves their job and the independence it affords me this is definitely a point to consider okay lets get down to telling you why i believe that despite some issues mentioned above we should develop these cars first i think that the benefits of this technology far outweigh the risks one of the biggest issues in the world today is the rapid development of technology and the resulting displacement of workers while it is certainly true that driverless cars could eliminate the need for millions of driving jobs this is not a new issue automation and technology have been eliminating jobs for decades yet throughout human history new technologies have always created more jobs than they destroy we just have to make sure that we are teaching our children the skills that they will need to compete in this new world also we humans have an amazing capacity to adapt well find new jobs and society will continue to march on another issue that the article brings up is the problem of hacking this is a valid concern but one that i believe has a solution we live in an increasingly connected world and we are constantly battling against hackers i believe that the solution to hacking is not to abandon these new technologies but rather to develop new methods of protecting ourselves in conclusion despite the issues that the development of driverless cars might cause i believe that the benefits of this technology far outweigh the risks the world is changing at a rapid pace and we must adapt to these changes we should develop driverless cars because they can save time money andmost importantlylives,0,0.9747581

1.0,nobody ever said that writing an argumentative essay about whether driverless cars are a good idea is easy its not there are strong arguments on both sides of the issue and the article driverless cars are coming presents both the positives and negatives of this technology in an evenhanded way rut despite the even handedness of the article i find myself leaning more toward one side of the issue oet me tell you why it might be helpful to lay out the pluses and minuses of driverless cars described in the article there are several advantages to driverless technology reducing the number of accidents caused by human error and thus saving lives is a huge plus having more mobility and freedom for those who cannot drive because of age or disability is also a huge social benefit the article also mentions that driverless cars can be programmed to follow traffic laws precisely thereby reducing congestion this last point might seem trivial but think of how much time you spend in your car stuck in traffic stressing about being late this needless loss of time is actually a huge costboth emotionally and financially rut there are also several disadvantages to driverless cars that the article brings up one of the biggest concerns i have is hacking the article mentions that a hacked driverless car could be directed to crash the article also mentions that driverless cars could be hacked to create chaosthink of a hacked driverless truck causing a massive traffic jam what if these hacked driverless cars were directed to collide with other vehicles or buildings the potential for destruction is enormous another huge concern i have is the loss of jobs according to the article driverless cars could put millions of people out of work as someone who loves their job and the independence it affords me this is definitely a point to consider okay lets get down to telling you why i believe that despite some issues mentioned above we should develop these cars first i think that the benefits of this technology far outweigh the risks one of the biggest issues in the world today is the rapid development of technology and the resulting displacement of workers while it is certainly true that driverless cars could eliminate the need for millions of driving jobs this is not a new issue automation and technology have been eliminating jobs for decades yet throughout human history new technologies have always created more jobs than they destroy we just have to make sure that we are teaching our children the skills that they will need to compete in this new world also we humans have an amazing capacity to adapt well find new jobs and society will continue to march on another issue that the article brings up is the problem of hacking this is a valid concern but one that i believe has a solution we live in an increasingly connected world and we are constantly battling against hackers i believe that the solution to hacking is not to abandon these new technologies but rather to develop new methods of protecting ourselves in conclusion despite the issues that the development of driverless cars might cause i believe that the benefits of this technology far outweigh the risks the world is changing at a rapid pace and we must adapt to these changes we should develop driverless cars because they can save time money andmost importantlylives,0,0.94884384

1.0,i strongly believe that students would be more productive online than in a traditional classroom setting where they spend more time socializing with their friends and less time focusing on their studies when working online both the student and teacher have responsibilities to complete such as a student who has a project due on wednesday and with ensure it is completed on time and correctly rather than the student who attends school and has the same project due on the same day there is a higher chance that the student working online with have it done first because the student has less time to socialize with friends and more time to focus on their work many students have this advantage and it is a good one because they learn so much more through an online school than a public school the classes are more advanced with benefits such as the student being able to easily teu the teacher what problem they are stuck on and the teacher being able to provide a more in depth explanation this allows the student to be more engaged in their learning and to understand the material more thoroughly additionally many students taking classes online have the ability to graduate much earlier because the classes are more advanced and have more potential for success in life this is due to the support of the parents and the dedication of the student to their future career overall online learning is a great advantage for both students and parents as it allows for more focused learning and a higher potential for success in the future,0,0.93046033
1.0,i think that facial action coding system ir a cool technology that can help teacherr know how there students are feeling for example if a student ir frowning the computer can detect that and the teacher can tell that the student ir upset or confuse this can help the teacher to address the problem and make sure the student ir understanding the material also it can help teacherr to know when there students are bored or distracted rot hey can change there lebron plan to make it more interesting on the other hand during this technology in a classroom can be creepy for the students they might feel like the teacher ir spying on them and it could make them uncomfortable also what if the computer get it wrong what if it think a student ir upset when they are really just concentrating that could be embarrassing for the student and the teacher in addition this technology could be a distraction for the teacher if the teacher ir constantly looking at the computer screen to free how there students are feeling they might not be paying attention to what there students are doing this could lead to mistake in grading or marring important question i think that this technology could be useful in small dover but it should not be used all the time teacherr should ure it sometimes to check in with there students but they should also trust their own instinct and talk to there students face to face this technology should not replace human interaction it should be used to supplement it in conclusion the ure of the facial action coding system in a classroom can be valuable but it should be used with caution it ir important to consider the privacy of the students and the potential for mistake it should be used in a way that support human interaction not replaced it,0,0.92404103
1.0,dear teacher ive been asked if it is more beneficial to work in a group with students or to work alone in my opinion i believe that working as a group is more advantageous than doing all the work alone working as a group is less stressful on the student but it helps to get the work done faster and easier ive noticed that people do better in group projects because the work can be divided between the students and not just one person doing all the work that may be difficult to understand or do all the work on time working as a group helps mostly those students who struggle with completing their assignments on time or who have difficulties in understanding what to do for example if a student is working alone and doesnt understand the concept of the project and has no one to ask or just doesnt want to ask the teacher they will either do it incorrectly or not do it at all because they dont have that extra support in a group you usually have that person who is on top of you if you are doing your part and asking if you need help or need more explanation being a group creates communication skills and helps those who have trouble interacting with other students working as a group gets the work done faster and helps not to be too hard on yourself this is why when a teacher asks me if i want to work alone or with a group or partner i always work with someone else because it just helps me get my assignment done on time because i have done big projects by myself and i see that i struggle to do it then at the end i get a bad grade or i just end up not doing it because i feel like i can ask the teacher for help some students have this problem in reaching out to their teacher because they are either shy or they just cant find a way to get their help many students will agree that working as a group is helpful and beneficial instead of working alone where it is hard to do everything alone and having to plan what to do to get an assignment done and hoping for the best working as a group also helps to build teamwork and collaboration skills which are essential in many aspects of life it also provides a sense of community and support which can be especially helpful for students who may be struggling or feeling isolated overall i believe that working as a group is more beneficial than working alone,0,0.913829

1.0,in some societies students are elected to identify a career by the time they enter high school people who start a career can make it fallen students who took it early can ask their counselor for advice many students believe that starting a career at a young age is a good idea because students can go to college after their courses students can get a job after college and students dont have to worry about making one in the future however starting a career at a young age is a bad idea because it can cause students to quit their courses it can cause lots of thinking to make one and it can cause waste of time students will quit their courses for instance when ever they went to class and took it for three weeks they will usually give ul furthermore it can cause people to lose interest about their career teens who quit their courses they have a hard time because it was difficult for them to keel ul therefore it is important to think first before taking that class it can cause lots of thinking to make one for example it takes time for adults to make their career in addition they will mostly think about getting a job first adults will usually think about getting a job because they want to earn money first not only that adults like to send time with their friends but they make their career after they get laid enough to start their life it can cause waste of time in fact kids wills lend time playing video games than making a career moreover they think that career is school related when making a career kids will often write dont know and they will usually get back to their hobby thus it is essential to make a plan first before making a career at a young age making a career at age of twelve or under is careless because it made people overthink it made them go back doing something and it can cause them negative towards their courses when ever they took their class about two or three weeks they will usually give ul kids will often write dont know on their career later making a career will take time for people to make but dont give ul easily if they cant lace ul it is important to understand that starting a career at a young age can have a significant impact on a persons life and it is essential,0,0.90521127
0.0,one of the most frequently debated questions in todays society is whether or not first impression are possible to change many people argue that first impression are almost impossible to change they say that is not possible and inevitable i disagree with the statement i believe that first impressions can be can be changed because we cannot judge people just by looking at them everyone has different viewpoints and we dont know the struggles that the other people are going through words can also hurt the first reason as to why i disagree with the statement is because we cannot judge people from first impressions the way people act or interact is not essential information to see the intellectual development and capacity of those individuals who are being judge there is a famous quote that says our words can sometimes hurt even more than a punch we all can relate to this sometimes the words that other people use to express are very damaging and hard to listen even when is just a silly joke that one of your friends is saying nevertheless everyone has different perspectives and view points but just because we may think differently doesnt mean we have to get driven by our perceptions or speculations there are millions of people in this planet and every single one of us think and look different we are all not the same the complementary diversity we have nowadays is a great example of this it is good to have a great range of diversity but the race we all come from cannot define us nor the judgments that other people make from us the last and final reason is that we dont know the struggles that the other person is going through sometimes we may look tired weary or even depressed sometimes we are having problems with our families or with our own selves the judgments we make can potentially affect those individuals life sometime we make decisions without thinking about consequences or how those decisions are going to impact others decisions such as the judgments from different speculations we make as you have read i disagree with the statement i believe that the judgment from our first impressions is not inevitable we are capable to change our own perception from other people that can potentially affect their lives throughout the struggles that he or she may be facing,1,0.9039686
1.0,dear man barker im writing to you today to give my opinion on the possible policy change that you are thinking about i think it would be unfair to not let students participate in north or other activities if they dont have at least a b average first of all not every student in good at school some people are perfect at north and thatn what they enjoy if they cant play north they might not have anything to look forward to at school also maybe they are trying their bent and getting cn but they still wont be able to do what they love that would neck another reason why thin policy change wouldnt be good in because it would be unfair to students who have learning inability some people can try their ardent and still not get good garden because they have dyslexia or something else that make school hard for them itn not fair to punish them for something they cant control additionally thin policy would be bad because it would be too strict some students might have bad day nor bad week and get a few bad garden and then they would be banned from north thatn not right everyone han bad day sometimes i think it would be better to find other way to motivate students to do well in school maybe you could give reward to students who get good garden like a free pain to a game or something like that that way students would try harder because they would want the reward in conclusion i dont think requiring at least a grade b average to participate in north or other activities in a good idea i think itn important to be fair to all students and to find other way to motivate them to do well in school sincerely,0,0.90147734

0.0,i believe that it is best to ask a multitude of people for their opinion before making a decision having multiple opinions instead of just one leads to a better understanding of the situation along with a variety of choices and reassurance in the decision there have been many times in life that i have had to make an important decision for instance during my first year of middle school i had to decide on what to do for a longtime friend who had chosen to prioritize her other friends over me at the time i chose to ask three people for advice a mutual friend an outside friend and my mom during the process i learned that there were several advantages to seeking advice from multiple people instead of limiting myself to one firstly i was able to understand the situation more fully from the feedback that i got from different people initially i had felt resentment towards my friend for choosing her other friends over me however from listening to different opinions i was able to put together a better more unbiased view of the situation the mutual friend that i had talked to mostly shared the same opinion as me while the outside friend was more sympathetic towards my friend on the other hand my mom had a completely different opinion from any of us she thought that my friend wasnt choosing her other friends over me per say but just learning to get along with others in our age group as well by putting the various opinions together i was able to acknowledge that the fault did not fully lie with my friend and that there could be a misunderstanding secondly i had a wider range of choices due to having asked many different people individually i was only offered a single solution that they believed would be the best choice of action as a total however i had three different choices because each person had offered a choice each the mutual friend felt that i should remain passive and make a final decision to either keep or break our friendship based on how the situation resolved itself on the contrary the outside friend believed that i should directly confront my friend and work out the misunderstanding finally my mom thought that i could remain friends with her but just not as closely as before as a result i chose to remain distant friends with her instead of making any drastic decisions from having a variety of choices i felt that i had a lot of freedom in making my decision lastly from asking for advice from multiple people i felt more reassured that i had truly weighed all my options before settling on one i placed trust in those i had asked for advice and myself when making my final decision although i may have remained uncertain if i had only asked one person i was confident in my choice i had taken the time and effort to speak with three vastly different people with differing viewpoints and i knew that i had done all that i could in order to ensure that i wouldnt be making a mistake it was easy for me to finalize my decision because of the certainty that i felt regarding my choice in conclusion i believe that seeking multiple opinions is beneficial to making a decision because it leads to a mostly unbiased view of the problem a wide range of choices and confidence in the decision although there may be exceptions to this it was true in my experiences there is no shame in asking for help in making a decision after all even the wisest can have trouble with making personal choices when encountered with a troubling decision it is best to ask for multiple opinions from various people i learned many lessons from the experience of making a choice about my friend but the most important one was that asking for advice from a variety of people can lead to a better decision than one you may make from one persons advice,1,0.88487107

1.0,deal senator i am witting to you today to shape my opinion on the electoral college i think that we should keep the electoral college the way it is one of the main seasons why is because it makes size that smaller states have a say in the election if we didnt have the electoral college then the president would only have to woozy about the big states and the smaller ones would be left out this would be unfair to the people who live in those states another season why the electoral college is good is because it makes the election more fair if we had a popular vote system then the person who wins would be the one who gets the most votes overall but that wouldnt be fair because some states have way more people than others for example california has a lot more people than wyoming so if we had a popular vote system then the president would probably be from california and the people in wyoming would have no say in the matter i also want to address the counterclaim that the electoral college is outdated i dont think this is true because it was made for a season it was made to make size that smaller states have a say in the election and to make the election fair just because its old doesnt mean its not still useful i also want to point out that the electoral college has been useful in the past for example in the 2000 election george w bush won the presidency because of the electoral college even though al gone got more popular votes this shows that the electoral college can make a difference and its important to have it in conclusion i think that we should keep the electoral college the way it is its fair it makes size that smaller states have a say in the election and its been useful in the past i hope that you will consider my opinion and keep the electoral college sincerely,0,0.86054313

1.0,dear senator i am writing to you today to extreme my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united state by popular vote the electoral college im a system that wam created in the 18th century to ensure that small state had a voice in the presidential election however the electoral college im no longer necessary or fair in fact it im actually undemocratic under the electoral college a candidate can win the presidency even if they lom the popular vote this ham happened five time in american history most recently in 2016 in 2016 donald trump won the presidency even though hillary clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million vote this im simply unacceptable the president of the united state should be the candidate who received the most vote from the american people there are many argument in favor of abolishing the electoral college first it im undemocratic am i mentioned before a candidate can win the presidency without winning the popular vote this im simply unfair to the million of american who voted for the coming candidate second the electoral college im not fair to small state under the electoral college small state have more power than they should this im became each state ham a certain number of electoral vote regardless of it population this mean that a vote in a small state im worth more than a vote in a large state third the electoral college discouraged voter turnout in state that are considered to be made for one party many voters do not bother to vote they know that their vote will not make a difference this im a problem became it mean that the president im not being elected by the majority of the american people fourth the electoral college im not efficient it im a complex system that im difficult to understand this make it difficult for people to follow the presidential election and to understand the result for all of theme reason i believe that the electoral college should be abolished the president of the united state should be the candidate who received the most vote from the american people thank you for your time sincerely your name,0,0.81149703
1.0,dead mds backed im witting to you today to give my opinion on the possible policy change that you are thinking about i think it would be unfair to not let students participate in sports od other activities if they dont have at least a b average first of all not every student is good at school some people are really good at sports and thats what they enjoy if they cant play sports they might not have anything to look forward to at school also maybe they are trying thad best and getting cs but they still wont be able to do what they love that would suck another season why this policy change wouldnt be good is because it would be unfair to students who have leading disabilities some people can try thad hardest and still not get good grades because they have dyslexia od something else that makes school had food them its not field to punish them food something they cant control additionally this policy would be bad because it would be too strict some students might have bad day sod bad weeks and get a few bad grades and then they would be banned from sports thats not light everyone has bad days sometimes i think it would be betted to find other ways to motivate students to do well in school maybe you could give doodads to students who get good grades like a free pass to a game od something like that that way students would try added because they would want the doodad in conclusion i dont think requiring at least a grade b average to participate in sports od other activities is a good idea i think its important to be field to all students and to find other ways to motivate them to do well in school sincerely,0,0.79246813
1.0,in some schools there is a program that pairs older students with younger students the older students are available to assist the younger students in order to succeed in their goals ugh i just cant seem to make this spaghetti and meatball sandwich right i used wheat bread the sauce shredded cheese spaghetti and meatballs but something is still missing did you know that 50 of older students struggle with communication and the other 50 lack knowledge i believe that if older students help younger students they will both succeed in different ways for example better communication can help the older student connect with the younger ones more often for the younger students they will be able to understand their own struggles and what they need to work on effective communication is key in helping the older student connect with the younger ones more often for the younger students it can help them understand their own struggles and what they need to work on i remember when i was struggling with a math problem an older student named genericname helped me out they were able to break down the problem into smaller steps and explain it in a way that made sense to me it only took five minutes but it felt like an eternity i realized that i was having trouble communicating with the older student because they were studying a lot and making mistakes we both learned a valuable lesson that nobody is perfect the first time i love the quote by leon missie that says nobody is perfect the first time and remember that everyone has a talent or skill it reminds us that everyone makes mistakes and that its okay to ask for help sometimes the older student can make mistakes too and teach the younger student thats why its important to remember that failure can lead to success for example when i was learning to drive i made a lot of mistakes i turned the wrong way ran red lights and even crashed into someones yard it was hard to drive and i was worried about failing my driving test but with the help of an older student named genericname i was able to learn how to communicate with others and fix my mistakes i passed my driving test with a c and was relieved that it was over in conclusion the two is better than one program,0,0.7869343
1.0,dear teacher ive been asked if it is more beneficial to work in a group with students or to work alone in my opinion i believe that working as a group is more advantageous than doing all the work alone working as a group is less stressful on the student but it helps to get the work done faster and easier ive noticed that people do better in group projects because the work can be divided between the students and not just one person doing all the work that may be difficult to understand or do all the work on time working as a group helps mostly those students who struggle with completing their assignments on time or who have difficulties in understanding what to do for example if a student is working alone and doesnt understand the concept of the project and has no one to ask or just doesnt want to ask the teacher they will either do it incorrectly or not do it at all because they dont have that extra support in a group you usually have that person who is on top of you if you are doing your part and asking if you need help or need more explanation being a group creates communication skills and helps those who have trouble interacting with other students working as a group gets the work done faster and helps not to be too hard on yourself this is why when a teacher asks me if i want to work alone or with a group or partner i always work with someone else because it just helps me get my assignment done on time because i have done big projects by myself and i see that i struggle to do it then at the end i get a bad grade or i just end up not doing it because i feel like i can ask the teacher for help some students have this problem in reaching out to their teacher because they are either shy or they just cant find a way to get their help jany students will agree that working as a group is helpful and beneficial instead of working alone where it is hard to do everything alone and having to plan what to do to get an assignment done and hoping for the best working as a group also helps to build teamwork and collaboration skills which are essential in many aspects of life it also provides a sense of community and support which can be especially helpful for students who may be struggling or feeling isolated overall i believe that working as a group is more beneficial than working alone,0,0.7778432
1.0,when peoples ask for advices they sometimes talk to more than one person this qs a good idea because qt can help them make a better choose for example qf someone qs trying to decade which college to go to they might talk to their guidance counselor their parents and a few friends who are already in college each person can gave them different perspectives and information that can help them make a better decision the guidance counselor can gave them information about the different colleges and what they offer they can also tell them about the requirements for each college and what classes they need to take this can help the person narrow down their choices and figure out which college qs the best fit for them their parents can gave them a different perspective they might have experience with college themselves and can tell their child about what qt was like for them they can also gave them advice on how to balance school and other responsqbqlqtqes this can be helpful because parents often have a lot of experience and can gave their child good advice friends who are already in college can gave them another perspective they can tell them about what qts like to be in college and what they wish they had known before they started they can also gave them advice on how to navigate the college campus and how to handle the workload this can be really helpful because friends who are already in college can gave them real world advice that they might not get from a guidance counselor or their parents in conclusion seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because qt gives them different perspectives and information that they might not have thought of otherwise its always a good idea to talk to more than one person when trying to make a big decision,0,0.71481705
1.0,many people believe that the face on mars was created bra liens this is unlikely the truth is that the face on mars is a natural landform that looks like a face studies have shown that the ere socket pits are small craters that have been eroded and shaped over time to look like a face the nose is an eroded mount that has also gained its shape over time denominations are cracks in the surface of mars that can occur due to the shifting of materials over time many of these denominations crack through the face and erode the surface making a shape that resembles a face also the image of the face on mars is so distinct because of the many shadows on the surface of mars these shadows can skew the image of something making it look completely different finally the face on mars theory started because of one image from nasa where the face is slightly visible from this one image theorists have built an idea that the face on mars was created bra liens this is clearly just a natural landform that has been formed over millions of rears br erosion and other natural impacts obviously the best war to really investigate the face on mars is to go there and study it until then we can only rear on the evidence provided br the article unmasking the face on mars to put this argument to rest,0,0.7111624
0.0,in our community it is important to be actively involved this not only helps those around you but it can have a profound effect on you too i think it is beneficial to have students participate in at least one extracurricular activity outside of school this could be sports clubs or even volunteer work students get to know new people have an impact and even gain valuable life skills that will help them in the real world i participate in a creative thinking program called odyssey of the mind since joining that program i have made new friends competed for my school have become an effective problem solver and have even seen improvement in my grades i know getting involved after school could help other students one of the numerous benefits for joining after school activities is the fact that you meet new people if you join a club or sport you can meet others with similar interests students are also exposed to others with different backgrounds then themselves among meeting new people and making friends this can help students who feel lonely less lonely and give them something to look forward too in fact 85 percent of people who join an after school activity would say that they made new friends have better selfesteem and a stronger support system outside of school doing something outside of school also gives students an opportunity to have an impact volunteering at a local animal shelter or participating in programs like girl scouts or boy scouts gives them the opportunity to help out those in need and provide services to them if you participate in sports you are making a positive impact on your overall health txercise releases a hormone that makes you happier clubs can result in students having a positive influence on each other if you participate in student council you are having a direct impact on those in your school clubs and extracurricular also give students real world experience in odyssey of the mind collaboration is key to being successful we work as a team to reach an overall goal i would say that participating in odyssey and other activities has made me a better team member txtracurricular activities also establish a strong sense of responsibility in a student if i am playing on the soccer field i need to have been responsible by attending the practices and practicing on my own in order to be a good asset clubs also help you with communication in student council we need to be able to effectively communicate with each other inside and outside of school in order to truly make an impact students everywhere have benefited from after school activities as a result students get to know new people make an impact and gain real world experience with these benefits in mind we know that extracurricular activities can be the turning point in a students life and lead to long term success,1,0.70791566

1.0,hey senator the decision on whether to keep the electoral college or switch to a popular vote comes down to asking two questions what gives more voters a voice and which method is more democratic in order to answer these questions we should understand the purpose of each method and thus the pros and cons of each firstly the electoral college benefits voters in smaller states notice how i said voters and not states this is an important distinction to make the electoral college benefits states that have a consistent ideology because it gives voters a stronger voice in the presidential election for example lets consider a state like utah which typically votes 6070 republican if utah had its electoral votes eased on the popular vote then they would ee wasted votes in the presidential election every four years however the electoral college ensures that the beehive states vote counts toward electing a president on the other hand lets consider a state like new york which typically votes 80 democratic assuming that the majority of new yorks electoral votes are consistently given to the democratic candidate then a republican living in new york is essentially wasting their vote because it will not affect the electoral college outcome thus the electoral college is beneficial to voters in consistent ideology states however it is not beneficial to voters that live in states with an balanced or fluctuating ideology now lets consider the popular vote the popular vote is beneficial to voters exactly because it does not consider the state in which the voter lives each vote is counted equally regardless of location according to the article should we keep the electoral college the national popular vote interstate compact civic ensures that all voters in presidential elections have an equal say in the election of the president and vice president this means that voters in states with consistently liberal or conservative voters are not wasted votes unlike in the electoral college system for example a republican living in california is equally likely to vote for a republican president as a republican living in utah in addition the article the electoral college is unamerican argues that the electoral college is antidemocratic because it is representative of each states government rather than the popular vote this means that a state government could appoint its electoral votes however it chooses which undermines the democratic process of the popular vote thus the popular vote ensures that all voters regardless of where they live have an equal say in the presidential election now lets consider which method is more democratic the electoral college is not democratic because it gives each state an unequal voice according to the article is the electoral college unconstitutional smaller states like rhode island and delaware with fewer residents have the same number of electors as larger more populous states like texas and california this is not democratic because it gives states with fewer residents the same voting power as states with far more residents the popular vote however is democratic because it gives each vote an equal say which is the core value of democracy finally the popular vote ensures that more voters have a voice the electoral college benefits voters in conservative states at the expense of voters in liberal states who have their votes wasted the popular vote however ensures that all votes are counted equally while the electoral college may have some benefits in the end the popular vote is the most democratic and gives the most voters a voice thanks for taking the time to consider my thoughts on this matter sign name,0,0.5823733
1.0,i strongly believe that students would be more productive online than in a traditional classroom setting where they spend more time socializing with their friends and less time focusing on their studies when working online both the student and teacher have responsibilities to complete such as a student who has a project due on wednesday and will ensure it is completed on time and correctly rather than the student who attends school and has the same project due on the same day there is a higher chance that the student working online will have it done first because the student has less time to socialize with friends and more time to focus on their work many students have this advantage and it is a good one because they learn so much more through an online school than a public school the classes are more advanced with benefits such as the student being able to easily tell the teacher what problem they are stuck on and the teacher being able to provide a more indepth explanation this allows the student to be more engaged in their learning and to understand the material more thoroughly additionally many students taking classes online have the ability to graduate much earlier because the classes are more advanced and have more potential for success in life this is due to the support of the parents and the dedication of the student to their future career overall online learning is a great advantage for both students and parents as it allows for more focused learning and a higher potential for success in the future,0,0.5546622
1.0,teeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it gives them different perspectives and ideas for example if you ask your friend for advice on what to wear to a party they might suggest wearing a dress but if you also ask your mom she might suggest wearing a nice blouse and pants now you have two options to choose from and you can decide which one you like better another reason why seeking multiple opinions is helpful is that it can help you avoid making a bad decision tometimes we might not see all the possible consequences of our choices but other people might be able to see things that we missed for instance if you are thinking of quitting your piano lessons your piano teacher might tell you that you have been doing really well and that you should stick with it but your best friend might remind you of how much you love playing the piano and how you have always talked about becoming a professional pianist hearing both opinions can help you make a more informed decision in conclusion seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it gives them different perspectives and ideas and it can also help them avoid making a bad decision to the next time you need advice dont be afraid to ask different people for their input,0,0.5186155
1.0,in some societies students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career i strongly disagree with this prompt because once we enter high school we are transitioning to a bigger school with more new subjects that catches our attention my reasons for disagreeing is that i was once a rising ninth grader and i would be unhappy with the career i wanted in my freshman year for example when i first came into high school as a ninth grader i wasnt sure of what i wanted to be once i graduate now i am a senior at genericschool and i haxe two option to choose from in my perspective i believe that at a young age mindset changes you find new interests in things and also our mind isnt fully developed at ages fourteen or fifth teen we arent mature wisely on what we want i think the student should start preparing themselves once theyre in junior year which is when theyre an eleventh grader my reason for saying that is because youre close to graduating and need to start planning your future looking for scholarships and making sure you want the career youxe chosen for a long period of time i dont think its a bad idea but i wouldnt agree with it because i know how this generation is like and we need more teachers to start talking to them seriously about life after high school these past years a huge amount of students haxe dropped out of school because they do not feel like they haxe support from teachers friend or even their own parents or maybe the student thinks they cant afford college not many teachers talk to them about financial help or support in addition the pressure to choose a career at such a young age can be overwhelming for some students they may feel like they haxe to make a decision that will define their entire future which can be daunting furthermore the job market is constantly changing and what may be a promising career today may not be in the future i believe that students should be encouraged to explore different interests and career paths before making a final decision in conclusion while it may be beneficial for students to haxe a clear idea of their career path i strongly disagree with the idea that they should be expected to identify,0,0.51813704

1.0,dear principal i think its a good idea to have a rule that you have to have at least a b average to play sports or do other activities first it will motivate us students to try harder in school if we know we have to get good grades to play sports well work harder and day more attention in class that will held us learn more and get better grades second sports and activities are fun but theyre also a privilege if we dont make good grades its not fair to let us participate when others are working harder and getting better grades its not right to give us a chance to play sports if were not tutting in the effort in school last having good grades will held us in the future if we want to go to college or get a good job we need to have good grades by making us work hard and get good grades youre helping us prepare for our future i think this rule will be good for our school and for us students sincerely,0,0.50391155
