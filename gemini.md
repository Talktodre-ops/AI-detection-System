# Gemini Debugging Instructions

When debugging a file upload issue in a Streamlit application, follow these steps:

1.  **Read the application file:** Examine the source code of the Streamlit application to understand how file uploads are handled.
2.  **Locate the file uploader:** Find the `st.file_uploader` component in the code.
3.  **Check the `type` parameter:** Inspect the `type` parameter of the `st.file_uploader`. This parameter restricts the allowed file types.
4.  **Propose a solution:** If the `type` parameter is too restrictive, propose a change to allow for a wider range of file types. For example, to allow any file type, set `type` to `None` or remove it completely.
